# Persons_Reidentification_using_PyTorch
Implementing siamese network with triplet loss function to identify people.

In this project, I am implementing a Siamese Network, training the network with the Triplet loss function, creating Anchor, Positive and Negative image dataset, which will be the inputs of triplet loss function, through which the network will learn feature embeddings.
Siamese Network have plethora of applications such as face recognition, signature checking, person re-identification, etc. In this project, I am training a simple Siamese Network for person re-identification.
